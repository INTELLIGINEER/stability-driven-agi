## Keystone Papers

These papers establish the physical and mathematical foundations of the
Stability-Driven AGI framework. All subsequent documents derive from
the results established here.

### KP-1: Phase-Locked Suppression of Turbulent Transport (2026)
Demonstrates mathematically that phase-locked control inputs can suppress
nonlinear turbulent transport in magnetized plasmas.

### KP-2: A Formal Isomorphism Between Plasma Turbulence and Cognitive State Stability
Establishes a rigorous dynamical isomorphism between plasma instability
and cognitive hallucination in open-loop AI systems.
