## Canonical Technical Foundations

The core scientific claims of this project are established in the
Keystone Papers:

- Phase-Locked Suppression of Turbulent Transport (2026)
- A Formal Isomorphism Between Plasma Turbulence and Cognitive State Stability

All AGI architecture, control theory, and system design documents
derive from these results.
