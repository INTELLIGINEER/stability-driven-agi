## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to clearly separate **canonical scientific results** from **derivative architecture and system design**.

**Important:**  
The authoritative scientific record for this work is the Zenodo DOI.  
This GitHub repository exists as a structured technical companion and implementation map.

The core scientific claims of this project are established in the
Keystone Papers:

- Phase-Locked Suppression of Turbulent Transport (2026)
- A Formal Isomorphism Between Plasma Turbulence and Cognitive State Stability

All AGI architecture, control theory, and system design documents
derive from these results.
